# JUI Win32  
win32 API bindings for JUI library, generated using JExtract
**YOU NEED TO USE JAVA 20 and its Experimental Features to not get any errors** 

### Installation  
It is generally not recommended to use them alone, but if you want, I won't 
be stopping you. They're mainly used for JUI, so you might find some roadblocks.  
- There will be probably downloadable JAR in releases  
- Maybe I'll put it on JitPack, we'll see about that  

### Contributing  
There are no contributions required nor needed.
